# Known peculiarities
This document contains a list of behavior peculiarities which are suboptimal but are in place for simplicity. They are not considered as bugs, but may be improved in the future.
1. If `total_balance`/`supply` is less than `1e-8` or more than `1e8` rounding inaccuracies may lead to losses. For instance `total_balance=100TON` and `supply=10e-9` (100 indivisible units), deposit of 19TON will give user 1 indivisible jetton unit. In other words 9 TON will be distributed over all jetton holders. *Countermeasure* is to keep `total_balance`/`supply` around 1.
2. Optimistic withdrawals are based on `total_balance`/`supply` ratio. In particular, it doesn't account for `FINALIZE_ROUND_FEE`. When round profit less than `FINALIZE_ROUND_FEE` (usually that means that there are no working validators) losses (quite minor though) are socialized amidst jetton holders.
3. When `total_balance=0` and `supply>0` deposits won't work due to division by zero. It is expected behavior since jetton lost all value and there is no correct way to account deposits.
4. When `total_balance>0` and `supply=0` (that may happen due to donations to empty pool) Pool can not loan credits since can not calculate how much TON need to be reserved for withdrawal. *Countermeasure* is the correct protocol of launching: first deposit (it is better if deposit >10k) and then `FINALIZE_ROUND_FEE` donation
